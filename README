Type:
make
to compile and link the code.
Type
make run
or
make
./lab1
to run the tests.

You can also run it with options:
To show info about individual tests that fail:
./lab1 -v
To show info about individual tests that fail and abort after first failure:
./lab1 -e -v
To abort after first failure:
./lab1 -e 
To get help info:
./lab1 -h 


If you want to implement the Tools.C methods in the order in which they are tested, it
is convenient to use both the -v and -e options.  

If you want to skip around implementing the methods, don't use the -e option.
